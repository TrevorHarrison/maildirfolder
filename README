This is the README for maildirfolder.


Q) What is maildirfolder?
A) maildirfolder assists delivery of sub-addressed messages directly into matching courier-imap Maildir folders.


EXAMPLE:

You are subscribed to the goatlovers mailing list as bob-goatlovers@weirdbob.com.
You want any email addressed to your address of bob-goatlovers to be delivered into a goatlovers folder in your imap account.

The old way:

# echo "./Maildir/.goatlovers/" > .qmail-goatlovers

Repeat for each mailing list you subscribe to.  If you ever move your goatlovers folder via your imap client, edit the .qmail file to reflect that.

The new way with maildirfolder:
# echo "|maildirfolder ./Maildir/" > .qmail-default

Thats it.  maildirfolder will lookup goatlovers in your ./Maildir/courierimapsubscribed file and use safecat to deliver the message directly to
that directory, as if you had specified ./Maildir/.path.to.goatlovers.folder/ in your .qmail file.
Moving the goatlovers imap folder will not screw anything up.

Mapping subaddress A-B-C to a folder name occurs in the following order:

 Foldername
 ----------
 A.B.C         (ie. exact match)
 A.B           (drop the last part of the address and then try to find an exact match)
 A             (drop the last 2)
 *.A.B.C       (find a unique A.B.C anywhere in the folder list)
 *.A.B         (find a unique A.B anywhere)
 *.A           (hell, can I just find A?)

Lookup example:
bob-goatlovers-announce@weirdbob.com, when delivered via your .qmail-default file, the EXT env var will be just goatlovers-announce.
The foldernames that will be looked up will be:
 1) goatlovers.announce
 2) goatlovers
 3) *.goatlovers.announce
 4) *.goatlovers

And if all lookups fail, maildirfolder will default back to the base ./Maildir/
If there is a trailing match (*.A.B.C), it must be unique.


SECURITY ISSUES:
Hostile email messages can be delivered into any imap folder you have setup.
Create a ./Maildir/hiddenfolders files and list the folders you don't want maildirfolder to deliver to.  (Same format as courierimapsubscribed.)
If the hiddenfolders file is absent, Sent, Trash, and Drafts are excluded by default.


REQUIREMENTS:
courier-imap managed Maildir folders
safecat (in the path)
.qmail delivery files

COMPILING:
make maildirfolder

INSTALLATION:
cp maildirfolder /usr/local/bin/maildirfolder
echo "|maildirfolder ./Maildir/" > .qmail-default

USAGE:
maildirfolder <path_to_courier-imap_maildir> [-d]

-d causes some info to be logged to syslog's mail log.

RUNTIME ERRORS:
All runtime errors cause a exit with a value of 111 (qmail temporary failure, try again)

"Missing dest maildir argument" - you need to specify the maildir path as the first argument... ie. maildirfolder ./Maildir/
"Maildir path too short ( <2 ): <path>" - the maildir path is really short and I'm nervous
"Bad or missing tmp maildir dir: <path>/tmp" - couldn't stat the folder's tmp dir, or it wasn't a directory
"Bad or missing new maildir dir: <path>/new" - same as tmp
"Bad or missing safecat" - exec failed when trying to run safecat.  Is it in the path?

DEBUGGING:

Debugging address to folder lookup failures:
verify that your EXT env var is showing your subaddress correctly:

Add -d to end of maildirfolder line, so that your .qmail file looks like:
|maildirfolder ./Maildir/ -d

Send another test message to your subaddress (ie. bob-goatlovers@weirdbob.com)

tail your syslog'd maillog, look for lines that start with maildirfolder.

EXT should be whatever is after your main userid... ie. in this example, just "goatlovers".
